                              <b> Marks: 989 / 1100  Grade: A+</b> <br>
                                I excelled in my FSc Pre-Engineering studies, demonstrating a strong academic performance. During this time, I developed a keen interest in technology and engineering principles, which sparked my passion for problem-solving and paved the way for my future studies and career in Software Engineering.

                <p>
                    <b>Project Overview:</b><br>
                    As part of my semester project, I designed and developed a robust Library Management System (LMS) using C++. The system is tailored to meet the practical requirements of educational institutions, offering seamless book management, user authentication, and interactive features.

From issuing books to tracking overdue returns and calculating fines, this solution automates and simplifies the day-to-day operations of a traditional library environment. <br><br>

                    <b>Core System Architecture:</b><br>
                    The system is structured around four primary classes: BookInfo, IssueBook, UserInfo, and Security. The BookInfo class manages book entries, updates, deletions, and displays, while tracking the number of available copies. The IssueBook class governs book issuing protocols—allowing a 7-day borrowing period for students and 21 days for teachers—and automatically calculates fines for late returns based on the number of overdue days. The UserInfo class maintains user records, and the Security class ensures access control through proper authentication mechanisms using username, password, and email. <br><br>

                    <b>User Experience & Search Capabilities:</b><br>
                    The LMS is designed with the end-user in mind, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for all types of users. It facilitates comprehensive book searches using multiple criteria such as ISBN number, book title, author name, publisher, and publication date. Whether the user is a librarian managing inventory or a student looking for specific materials, the system ensures fast, accurate, and user-friendly interactions. <br><br>

                    <b>Security, Smoothness & Speech Integration:</b><br>
                    To protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, a robust security module has been implemented. It includes user verification through credentials and integrates barricade logic to ensure smooth transitions and controlled flow between system modules. One of the standout features of the LMS is the integration of a speech acknowledgment system. This voice output functionality allows the system to "speak" to users—offering auditory confirmations, notifications, and instructions. This not only enhances accessibility but also creates a more interactive and engaging user experience. <br><br>

                    <b>Achievements & Learning Outcomes:</b><br>
                    Developing this LMS gave me hands-on experience in applying object-oriented programming principles to solve real-world problems. It strengthened my skills in C++ programming, system design, file handling, and user interface logic. Implementing advanced features like fine calculation, voice acknowledgment, and secure user authentication taught me the importance of blending functionality with user convenience. This project stands as a complete, deployable solution and a milestone in my academic journey, demonstrating both technical depth and practical relevance. <br><br>

                <b>Project Overview:</b><br>
                To tackle the increasing challenges faced in peanut agriculture, particularly in areas such as variety classification, disease diagnosis, and pest identification, I developed a comprehensive and intelligent image classification system dedicated to peanut crop analysis. This innovative solution is designed to support farmers, agricultural researchers, and agritech platforms by providing accurate and reliable identification of peanut types, harmful pests, and plant diseases. By integrating state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and advanced image processing methods, the system aims to revolutionize traditional agricultural practices, enhance decision-making, and ultimately contribute to healthier crop management and improved yields. <br><br>

                <b>Functional Modules:</b><br>
                The project is strategically structured into three core modules, each addressing a specific aspect of peanut crop analysis. The Peanut Classification module focuses on identifying and categorizing different types of peanuts based on distinct visual characteristics, assisting in quality control and variety management. The Peanut Pest Identification module is designed to detect and classify various pests that pose threats to peanut crops, enabling early intervention and minimizing potential damage. Meanwhile, the Peanut Disease Detection module specializes in diagnosing common diseases in peanut plants through detailed analysis of leaf and crop imagery, supporting timely and accurate treatment decisions. <br>
                To integrate these functionalities into a cohesive system, we utilized two publicly available datasets for the Peanut Pest Identification and Peanut Disease Detection modules. For the Peanut Classification module, we developed a custom dataset from scratch, capturing and curating images of various peanut types.<br><br>

                <b>Advanced Deep Learning Algorithms:</b><br>
                The core of this project is built on advanced deep learning techniques and meticulous data engineering. To achieve high accuracy across all modules, I initially employed several state-of-the-art pretrained models, including ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B0 and B4. However, these models did not consistently reach the desired accuracy threshold of beyond 98%. To overcome this, I leveraged more advanced architectures that combine convolutional neural networks with the cutting-edge transformer concept—specifically, the ConvNeXt variants (Tiny, Small, and Base). These models not only delivered state-of-the-art performance but also set a new benchmark in accuracy and robustness for peanut crop classification, pest detection, and disease identification.<br><br>

                <b>User Interface and System Deployment:</b><br>
                A fully integrated web interface was developed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, ensures a responsive and visually intuitive design that performs smoothly across all devices. On the backend, PHP and MySQL power robust user management and efficient data handling, maintaining reliability and security. To bridge the deep learning models with the platform, a custom Flask API was implemented, enabling dynamic, real-time predictions from user-uploaded images.

                <div class="case-study-description">
                    <p>
                        In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, establishing a strong digital presence has become crucial for businesses across various industries. With the real estate sector being no exception, there's a growing demand for intuitive and visually appealing websites that showcase properties effectively. This case study delves into the development of a real estate website, leveraging HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to meet the client's needs and expectations. <br><br>

                        <b>Client Background:</b><br>
                        Our client, a real estate entrepreneur, recognized the importance of adapting to digital trends to stay competitive in the market. With a vision to expand their business and reach a wider audience, they sought to digitalize their operations by investing in a robust real estate website. Their goal was to create a user-friendly platform that enables seamless property browsing and enhances the overall customer experience. <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Challenge:</b><br>
                        Developing the real estate website posed challenges in optimizing functionality and performance. Designing an intuitive user interface for property showcasing and navigation was crucial. Integrating advanced search features and building a robust backend system with PHP and MySQL were technical hurdles. Ensuring data security and efficient database management were top priorities. Despite these challenges, I remained dedicated to delivering a secure and seamlessly functioning platform that fulfills the client's vision of enhancing the real estate experience for both buyers and sellers. <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Solution:</b><br>
                        To optimize functionality and performance and develop an interactive look for the real estate website, I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Leveraging HTML and CSS, I crafted a visually appealing and intuitive user interface for showcasing properties and enabling seamless navigation. Bootstrap provided a responsive design framework, ensuring the website's compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. JavaScript enhanced interactivity, incorporating dynamic elements such as image sliders and interactive maps to engage users effectively. <br>
                        For integrating advanced search features and building a robust backend system, I employed PHP and MySQL. PHP facilitated the development of dynamic web pages, allowing for seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components. MySQL served as the database management system, for storing property information securely and efficiently. Advanced search functionalities were implemented using PHP to query the database based on various criteria, such as location, price range, and property type. <br>
                        To address security concerns and ensure the protection of sensitive information in the database, I implemented hash functions for password storage and data encryption. This added an extra layer of security, safeguarding against potential breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data. By prioritizing both functionality and security, I successfully delivered a high-quality, responsive real estate website that met the client's objectives and enhanced their online presence in the competitive market. <br>

                    <p>I designed and developed glamgallerywallart.com, a fully customized Shopify store tailored for a niche wall art brand. The project involved building the store from scratch with a focus on a clean, modern layout and seamless user experience. One of the key highlights of this store is the unique product variant image functionality, where variant selections dynamically update the product gallery — enhancing the shopping experience.
